## Backend description
Backend is simulated by reading data from a JSON file and storing it in localStorage. When performing CRUD operations data in localStorage is modified. Since there is no real backend and data is not permanently saved in a database, it is lost when localStorage is cleared. Of course clearing stored data at this point is not correct and done intentionally for testing purposes only.
